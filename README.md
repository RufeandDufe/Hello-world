I LOVE brisket and hashbrown tacos from Bill Miller on Tuesday mornings.

Listening to Pandora on Alexa tonight and heard Hayley Westenra singing "Prayer".  It's so beautiful that I looked up the lyrics.
Found they were beautiful too and longed to see and hear Allie sing it to the boys as they fall asleep.
Sent her the the title and lyrics.

Also heard Hallulujah and looked up its lyrics.  Always wanted to be able to play that on a guitar and sing too.
